          <p>2020-2023</p>
          <p>
            The course was focused on learning the mechanics of how games work on a technical level, particularly on OpenGL, Bullet Physics, and Ogre3D to create our own graphics engine. In addition, 2D and 3D games were created as assignments with an aim to make mechanics that allowed people with accessibility issues to be able to understand the game as much as people without.
